# Modulation recognition using Persistent Homology

The aim of this project is to test feature generation pipeline using persistent homology 
with application to modulation classification problem.

## About the dataset

The dataset consists of synthetic and over-the-air radio signals with different modulations. 
It was generated as a basis of the paper [[1]](#1). 
Signals with various modulation types were generated using the following schema

## How to run this project

After cloning the repository set up virtual environment and install requirements

```
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project uses DVC (Data Version Control) to run data processing pipelines. 
To download datasets set-up password to remote SSH storage, and pull the data:
```
dvc remote modify --local ssh-storage password [put_password_here]
dvc pull
```

Run the "spotcheck" stage to see the ranking of classifiers
```
dvc repro spotcheck
```

Run the "evaluate_model" stage to see performance of the best model
```
dvc repro evaluate_model
```

To see the accuracy of the best model and its confusion matrix run
```
dvc metrics show
dvc plots show
```
